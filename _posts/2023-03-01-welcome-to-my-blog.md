Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Juan Camacho Mohedano, and I'll be sharing my thoughts, projects, and research here.

<!--more-->

## Why I Started This Blog

I created this blog to share my thoughts, research, and experiences in Computer Science and Software Engineering. I believe that sharing knowledge is one of the best ways to contribute to the community and also to clarify my own understanding of complex topics.

## What to Expect

Future posts will cover topics such as:

- Recent developments in Machine Learning and AI
- Software engineering best practices
- Project walkthroughs and tutorials
- Summaries of research papers I find interesting

## Code Example

Jekyll supports syntax highlighting for code. Here's an example:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    
hello_world()
```

## Mathematical Equations

Jekyll also supports LaTeX equations through MathJax. Here's an example:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

## Conclusion

I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and work with you all. Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
